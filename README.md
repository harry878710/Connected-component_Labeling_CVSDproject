# Connected-component_Labeling_CVSDproject

Brief introduction:
  1. Detected patterns lie in the binary image and labeled the pixels in the same pattern with identical ID number written in Verilog
  2. Processed data with 512x8 SRAM and used Two-pass algorithm to label all of the pixels in the pattern correctly
  3. Done APR and passed all patterns in post-layout simulation
  4. Declined performence: AT^2 by efficient algorithm and using pipeline

The regulation is described in 109__final.pdf
